# shaders-with-sodium
This is a small repository designed to help users who want shaders with Sodium but without using Iris or vanilla Fabulous shaders .
If you don't know already, Sodium does NOT work with Optifine shaders. This can be overcome using [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris) but it requires a decent amount of technical know how.

**NOTE: Both [MCPP](https://github.com/LambdAurora/MCPatcherPatcher) and [Colormatic](https://github.com/kvverti/colormatic) are under the [LGPL License](https://github.com/LambdAurora/MCPatcherPatcher/blob/main/LICENSE) and [FabricSkyBoxes](https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes) is under the [MIT License](https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/blob/1.16.x-master/LICENSE). All three binaries which I have provided are unmodified from the original source code.**

This repository is under the [LGPL license](LICENSE.txt), which you can see below. Before asking for support, please be aware of its terms.

Alright, onto the actual thing. NOTE: This guide assumes you know how to install mods on the **Fabric** modloader and load resourcepacks. I'll be including more complicated instructions that make this work slightly (for now) better, this will be geared towards people who have more technical know-how.  

If you want me to change something or you find an error, just make an issue and if you want to do something *big*, make a pull request please.

Also this guide assumes you have Sodium installed already. Additionally, if you want that sweet, sweet, connected glass, I'd *highly* recommend this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/c1ddf9c2543ad0d56b8e49f80c283b99)

Also I wanna mention that there's a program called MCPPPP that's basically MCPP but it's an exe, and is harder to use. I'd recommend using it if and only if you know how to use the command line, and cd into folders and things like that. I'll be adding the more complicated guide bit at a later date. 

Steps:
1) Download the latest release from the releases page.
2) Extract the .zip into a separate folder. Do NOT extract the resourcepack after extracting the release, it is a .zip by default and will not work if you extract it.
3) Go to your `minecraft/mods` folder and paste the mods from the extracted .zip into that folder. 
4) Go to your `minecraft/resourcepacks` and drop the resourcepack into the folder. 
5) That's it! You're done
6) Now launch your game
7) Load the resourcepack that I included (it should go over all the other ones no matter what. Some exceptions apply, just make an issue and ask me. Whatever resourcepack you download from DragonEggBedrockBreaking's gist, place it *below* the resourcepack I included)

And you're done! Go get yourself a choccy milk and congratulate yourself.
